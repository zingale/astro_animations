Achieving Orbit
---------------

.. video:: ../../mechanics/achievingorbit/achievingorbit.mp4

A simple animation that shows a projectile with increasing horizontal
velocity, working up to the circular velocity.

Escape Velocity
---------------

.. video:: ../../mechanics/escapevelocity/escape.mp4

A simple animation showing how the orbit of a projectile around Earth
changes as we increase the change the tangential velocity from less
than the circular velocity to greater than the escape velocity.

Changing Orbit
--------------

.. video:: ../../mechanics/changing_orbit/changing_orbit.mp4

A simple animation showing how an initially circular orbit is changed
into an elliptical one by increasing the velocity at perihelion. Two
boosts are modeled.
