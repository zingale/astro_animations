Solar System Motion
===================

Planetary Orbits and Kepler's Laws
----------------------------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/orbit2/orbit2.mp4

Integrate the orbits of two planets around a star, neglecting the
gravitational force between the planets themselves. This is useful for
demonstrating Kepler's third law. We work in units of AU, years, and
solar masses. The semi-major axes are picked such that one planet has
an orbital period of 1 year and the other of 2 years.

As the animation plays, you should see that the speed of the outer
planet varies, becoming fastest at perihelion and slowest a
aphelion. You will also see that the outer planet takes longer to
complete its orbit around the Sun, since $P^2 \sim a^3$.

Kepler's Second Law
-------------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/second_law/second_law.mp4

A demonstration of "equal areas in equal times", by shading the area
swept out by a planet in equal time intervals.

Retrograde Motion
-----------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/retrograde/retrograde.mp4

Integrate Earth and Mars in their orbits around the Sun, starting a
bit before opposition, and draw a line indicating the line-of-sight to
Mars from Earth against some background stars to show the change in
apparent motion.

Note: the orbits are simplified here -- the semi-major axis and
eccentricity are correct, but it is assumed that both ellipses are
oriented the same way. For demonstration purposes, this is not all
that critical.

Parallax
--------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/parallax/parallax.mp4

A simple animation showing how parallax works, illustrating the motion
of the Earth around the Sun and the apparent shift seen in the
position of a nearby star against the background, more distant stars.

Mercury's Rotation
------------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/mercury_rotation/mercury_rotation.mp4

Illustrate a 3:2 resonance between the rotation period and orbital
period of Mercury. The semi-major axis and eccentricity for the planet
drawn match Mercury. The black dot on the surface of the planet
represents a person standing initially directly under the Sun at
perihelion.

Orbital Energy
--------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/orbitalenergy/orbitalenergy.mp4

A simple showing the orbit of a planet around the Sun, outputting the
kinetic energy / unit mass, the potential energy / unit mass, and the
total energy / unit mass along the way.

Resonances in the Asteroid Belt
-------------------------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/asteroid_resonance/asteroids.mp4

A 2:1 resonance between an asteroid (shown in red) and Jupiter (black)
as they orbit around the Sun. Some randomly placed asteroids are also
shown.

Tidal Locking
-------------

.. video:: ../../solar_system_motion/tidal_locking/tidal_locking.mp4

An illustration of tidal locking of a moon in orbit around a
planet. The rotation of the moon is visualized by coloring alternate
quadrants differently, and watching a stationary person rotate with
the moon.. The tidal distortion is always along the planet-moon line.
