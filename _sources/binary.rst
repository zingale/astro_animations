Binary Systems / Exoplanets
===========================

Binary Star Orbits
------------------

.. video:: ../../binary_exoplanets/binary_stars/binary_mratio=2_e=0.0.mp4

.. video:: ../../binary_exoplanets/binary_stars/binary_mratio=2_e=0.4.mp4

Animation of a binary pair orbiting their common center of mass (shown
as the black "x"). The case of e = 0 and e = 0.4 are shown, with a
mass ratio of 1 or 2. These animations show that, in a binary system,
the two stars are always opposite one another, with respect to the
center of mass, and must have the same period.

Binary System Reference Frame
-----------------------------

.. video:: ../../binary_exoplanets/binary_reference/binary_reference_mratio=4_e=0.4.mp4

A comparison of different reference frames for a binary system: the center of mass frame and
the frame centered on the more massive star.  This demonstrates that the eccentricity of the
ellipses and their orientation are the same in the two frames.

Planetary Orbit + Stellar Motion
--------------------------------

.. video:: ../../binary_exoplanets/planetary_orbit/planetary_orbits.mp4

Animation of a small body (planet) orbiting around a larger body
(star) showing the small motion of the larger body around the center
of mass. This uses a mass ratio of 50 between the two objects.

Radial Velocity Exoplanet Detection
-----------------------------------

.. video:: ../../binary_exoplanets/radial_velocity/radial_velocity.mp4

.. video:: ../../binary_exoplanets/radial_velocity_ell/radial_velocity_ell.mp4

Illustrate the radial velocity of a star with an unseen planet over
the course of a period. Here, the planet's mass was greatly
exaggerated to enhance the effect. We also restrict ourselves to being
in the plane of the orbits.  A circular and elliptical version is provided.

Eclipsing Binary System
-----------------------

.. video:: ../../binary_exoplanets/eclipsing_binaries/eclipsing_binary.mp4

Show an eclipsing binary system and the resulting lightcurve. Here we
assume that the smaller star is hotter (e.g., a white dwarf).

Transiting Planet System
------------------------

.. video:: ../../binary_exoplanets/planetary_transit/planetary_transit.mp4

Show a planet transiting across its parent star, and the resulting
lightcurve. This is similar to the eclipsing binary system animation
above, but now we assume that the smaller object (the planet) is cool.

Equipotentials
--------------

.. video:: ../../binary_exoplanets/equipotentials/equipotentials.mp4

An animation showing the equipotentials of the gravitational and
rotational potential in the co-rotating frame of a binary system. We
change the mass parameter, Î¼ = M2/(M1 + M2). In the frames, the less
massive star (M2) is on the left.
