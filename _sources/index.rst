Simple Astronomy Animations
***************************

A collection of astronomy animations produced for my intro astronomy classes.  These are
all written in python (using matplotlib) and the videos are rendered using FFmpeg.

* :ref:`earthmoon` : demonstrations of the orbit and phases of the moon and Earth's seasons.

* :ref:`ellipses` : animations showing the properties of ellipses

* :ref:`orbits` : demonstrations of different orbits a satellite can make around Earth.

* :ref:`solarsystem` : Kepler's laws, parallax, retrograde motion, and more

* :ref:`binary` : properties of binary star systems and exoplanet systems

* :ref:`thermo` : blackbody spectrum, random walk, thermal motion

* :ref:`waves` : properties of waves, including Doppler effect

* :ref:`nuclear` : nuclear physics concepts

.. note::

   All the source code for these animations is available on github: https://github.com/zingale/astro_animations
