Wave Propagation
----------------

.. video:: ../../waves/waves/waves.mp4

Show two waves of different wavelengths to illustrate the difference
between wavelength and frequency. The propagation speed of the two
waves is the same. The wavelengths are 1 and 1/4 cm, and the velocity
is 2.0 cm/s. A point "fixed" to a vertical line moves up and down as
the wave passes by, to illustrate the concept of frequency.

Doppler Effect
--------------

.. video:: ../../waves/doppler/doppler.mp4

Show a moving source emitting waves. The wavefronts are plotted as red
circles. The source has a speed of 1 m/s and the waves have a
propagation speed of 2 m/s. The wave frequency is 3 Hz.

Doppler Effect II
-----------------

.. video:: ../../waves/doppler2/doppler2.mp4

Show two moving sources emitting waves. The top source has a speed of
1 m/s and the bottom source has a speed of 0.5 m/s. The waves have a
propagation speed of 2 m/s and frequency of 3 Hz. This version shows
how the compression of wave fronts depends on the line of sight
velocity.
