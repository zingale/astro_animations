Thermodynamics and Radiation
============================

Blackbody Spectrum
------------------

.. video:: ../../radiation_thermodynamics/blackbody_wavelength/blackbody_wavelength.mp4

Show how the Planck function varies as temperature is changed. A
"thermometer" on the right keeps track of the temperature. Some
reference Planck function curves are plotted every 2
orders-of-magnitude in temperature to illustrate the shift in the
location of peak intensity with increasing temperature. Also, the
visible frequencies/wavelengths are highlighted with a blue shading.

Random Walk
-----------

A demonstration of a random walk process. A number of small hops are
taken in random directions, until the overall displacement is equal to
the radius of the circle.

Thermal Motion
--------------

.. video:: ../../radiation_thermodynamics/thermal_motion/normal/thermal_motion_normal.mp4

.. video:: ../../radiation_thermodynamics/thermal_motion/hot/thermal_motion_hot.mp4

A demonstration of the effect of temperature on random thermal
motion. Many particles in a gas are shown at two different
temperatures.

Note: for simplicity, we do not model collisions between the particles.
