Radioactive Decay

.. video:: ../../radioactive_decay/decay.mp4

A sequence of figures (each represent 1 half life) illustrating the
radioactive decay of a sample. Initially 2500 markers are
"parents". Each half life, there is a 50% chance a marker
decays. After a number of half lifes, no parents remain. A plot
showing the exponential decay follows.
