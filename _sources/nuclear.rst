Radioactive Decay
-----------------

.. video:: ../../radioactive_decay/decay.mp4

A sequence of figures (each represent 1 half life) illustrating the
radioactive decay of a sample. Initially 2500 markers are
"parents". Each half life, there is a 50% chance a marker
decays. After a number of half lifes, no parents remain. A plot
showing the exponential decay follows.

Hot CNO Cycle
-------------

.. video:: ../../nuclear_astro/hot_cno/hotcno.mp4

An animation of the changing reaction rates with temperature for the
reactions and nuclei involved in the CNO and hot-CNO cycle.  As the
temperature is increased, eventually the proton-captures become faster
than the beta-decays, putting us in the hot-CNO regime.
